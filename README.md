# Computational-Biology-Large-Data-Processing

A collection of R scripts made partially for personal practice and in completion of Computational Biology Lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institue.

Each element is broken into folders and then individually folders are available with data.
For reference mostly, but if downloaded for use reference folder will need to be changed.



Made from Sep - Dec 2025
